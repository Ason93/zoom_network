# Zoom-out-and-in Network for region proposal and object detection

The codebase for:
* (Nov 2016): Zoom network with recursive training, arXiv link: [[arXiv: 1702.05711]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05711)
* (July 2017): Zoom network with map attention decision, arXiv link: [[arXiv: 1709.04347]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04347)

**This codebase is written in Caffe with Matlab wrapper. It supports multi-gpu training. However, this is a quite old repo (active around early 2017) and I no longer maintain it.**

Then why open-source it? Simply I have a habit to publish code whenever some work is accepted.
